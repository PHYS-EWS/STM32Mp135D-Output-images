SDCard image file, as  generated by the completion of the Buildroot process for the STM32MP135D SBC 
Full process detailed in the following location

This Repo only hosts the SDcard image for the STM32MP135D SBC as I know it works. 

You will need to unzip the file, I needed to zip it as Github was upset it was over 25MB!

Make sure you format your SDCard on a linux box, formatting in windows never worked.
I used the Disks tool in Mint to format the SDcard (32GB) 

It generated  2x1MB 1x4MB 1x2MB and 1x60MB partitions when I ran the following command: 

sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync

Where sdX corresponds to the micro sd card device node ... use 'lsblk' command to determine node.
